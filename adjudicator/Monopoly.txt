State Documentation for the Monopoly Adjudicator:

ReceiveState:
-------------
This purpose of this function is to convey information to the player at certain points in the game. The adjudicator expects no response from the player here. However, we realise the player may need to update certain aspects in his game logic based on the newly provided information. Hence, the response to the adjudicator is recorded through a callback function from the player.
There are several stages in a given turn of the game where the adjudicator may wish to share information with a player. These are differentiated based on the PhaseNumber attribute of the state, which indicates which part of the turn the game is currently on. This will become clear in the examples listed below.

1) PhaseNumber = JAIL(6):
Sent in 2 scenarios. 
a) The player has been sent to Jail. 
b) The player was in Jail at the start of the turn. He chose to roll the dice to see if he gets doubles. He didn't and is still in Jail.

The difference in these 2 scenarios is that in (a), at the start of the turn, the player was not in Jail while in (b), he was.

2) PhaseNumber = DICE_ROLL:
Sends the value of both the dice rolled in a given turn.

3) PhaseNumber = AUCTION:
Sent at the end of an auction to show which player won. The attribute PhasePayload is set to the following format:

[<Auctioned Property ID>,<Winning Player's ID>,<Winning Bid>]

4) PhaseNumber = TRADE_RESPONSE:
The TRADE_RESPONSE phase represents the time when the player to whom the trade is proposed is given the chance to respond. Here, we let the player who proposed the trade know the response. The format would be:

[<Trade Response(Boolean)>,<otherAgentId>,<cashOffer>,<propertiesOffer>,<cashRequest>,<propertiesRequest>]
