          Monopoly is a very popular board game where the objective is for the player to amass as much money and/or property as they can. In the game, players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions.

          Our objective is to build a system which can host monopoly games between AI agents from around the world. We also have a user interface through which a user could play against AI agents.
